# MyNode_passportAuthentication
This is passport authentication with node.js and mysql.
There are two files in main folder server.js and config.js server.js is server file after downloading this open command propt and
run "node server" it will show you the port number on which the server is listening then open your browser and run localhost:"port
number" before doing this you have to on "wamp" or "xamp" server and creating database according to database.txt file.
config.js file is for database connectivity.
I set view engine to ejs so all file is views folder have extention of .ejs.
routes folder cantains all router files
In public/upload folder all the images are saved that you upload on sign up page.

This project is just showing complex functionality of passport authentication using node.js.The fornt end of this project is not too 
atractive but it will help you to understand some node.js modules for example multer, passport, cookie-parser, session-parser etc.


Thank you
